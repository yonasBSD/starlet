```

### `putenv(key, value)`

Sets the value of the environment variable named by the key, returning an error if any.

#### Examples

**basic**

Sets the environment variable `STARLET_TEST` to the value `123456`.

```python
load("runtime", "putenv")
putenv("STARLET_TEST", 123456)
```

### `setenv(key, value)`

Sets the value of the environment variable named by the key, returning an error if any.
Alias of `putenv`.

#### Examples

setenv("STARLET_TEST", "ABC")
```

### `unsetenv(key)`
